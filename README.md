# auto-ytdl

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Release-v1.2.0beta-green.svg)

I know, _yet another_ youtube-dl wrapper. But this one does something others don't: ability to automate your new music downloads, just like package managers automate your updates.

```
aytdl update
```

And that's it.
(Some initial setup is required of course, so auto-ytdl knows what music to download, but the most used commands are that simple)

## v1.2.0 changelog

> Soundcloud is now excplicitly supported, though the user should tweak config options to not be limited to free-tier low quality audio.
> Windows experimental support

# Why does it exist? / Motivation / Rant / you can skip this part

[DISCLAIMER: informal language]

Y'all know how we live in the 5G era, so for us music \* folks that would mean streaming music 24/7... but (one or more of):

- there is no mobile network / wifi at your office / parent's home / hotel room / on the road / at the back of your house
- you have a limited data allowance anyway
- spotify feels like both an ad gatling gun and a noisy radio (because of the network bandwith playing yo-yo)
- your entry-level phone/PC 2.4GHz antenna can't deal with both Wi-Fi music streaming and bluetooth connection to headphone/speakers
- youtube/yt music either replay the same 5 songs forever or goes its way on some crappy music that's unlike everything you like. It's a nice tool to discover new things, but not to actually listen to music. Some other services\*\* may be relevant to audiophile-class folks, but down here the _de-facto_ service for music is Youtube.
- yeah, music streaming is pretty not here yet

[DISCLAIMER: personal opinion]

For people who truly enjoy music \*, nothing beats yet having a local library, even with the hassle of managing, de-duplicating, and updating it constantly.

Auto-ytdl is there to help (you) with all that: there are tons of great artists that publish new songs everyday; having a local music library should not mean that we have to forsake listening to those!
Plus, auto-ytdl comes with management of duplicates of newly-downloaded songs, based on metadata so you don't have multiples identical song but from different youtube channels.

\* (_yes_ I know youtube and other video streaming services do not have extremely good audio, but it's out of convenience): hardcore audiophile abstain

# Doesn't it exist already?

No.

However, [olivia](https://github.com/keshavbhatt/olivia) is a music player that propose a similar feature named 'smart playlist', the beta I tested could auto-download individual songs. You may want to check it out!

It's more of an all-rounder and I believe auto-ytdl + your favorite music player may be a better combo _if your use case is similar to mine_.

[deserves mention for existing]

The closest idea I could find is MediaHuman's (paid, expensive, closed-source) Youtube-Downloader: as of writing, it seems to have 'tracking' capabilities, and little explications given.
All this looked a bit fishy, though it has a nice GUI. It also only offers a .deb package for "GNU/Linux OS" and .deb support for Arch (btw I use Arch) is not first-class.

# How does it works?

see also [Usage](#usage) and [Examples](#examples)

1. Add some of your favorite (youtube\*) channels / referencers /artists

2. At your next update command, all newly-released music from specified sources will be downloaded, cleaned, de-duplicated, and added to your music library.

3. [optionnal] Tinker with the options

\* playlist or channels from Dailymotion, vimeo or anything youtube-dl can download from can in theory work, but have not been tested yet

# Features

- Auto-download of all new music from a simple command (music-only download, best quality available (often opus format ~160kbps for youtube), no conversion by default)
- Add/remove/list all your favorite music providers; mainly tested on youtube and soundcloud channels, but should work on playlist, and other video platforms
- Clean tags, so e.g. the displayed artist name does _not_ look like "Nirvana (lyrics) [Music video] official" but just "Nirvana"
- Filter by tags so only 'true' and unique songs (according to config) end up in your library
- Ignore the filter if you really want that weird video
- Can still handle one-shot downloads, or include older songs of (newly discovered) artists
- Comprehensive config options
- No missing/skipping/forgetting songs, even if a previous download was interrupted
- Download video currently playing in chrome/youtube (link that one to a shortcut)
- Thumbnail embedding supported for mp3 and opus (default) format
